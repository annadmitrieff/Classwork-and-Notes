## 8.21 Private Meeting -- Notes

### Straightforward To-Dos:
- Re-do simulations with higher particle counts (1E8 particles per simulation--modify in `.setup` files).
  - Make sure image symmetries are off in MCFOST para file.
  - Download more relevant MCFOST para files for disc parameter analysis.
 
- Apply toy model to DSHARP Dataset; see what clusters are formed, how to modify methods for discs.
  - Is there a way to identify what parameters clustering is occuring under?
  - Cross reference with Sarah's work with discs (maybe even DSHARP data).
  
- Reach out to Sarah:
  - Summary of her prior work?
  - Suggestions/caveats of applying HCA to disc analysis?
  - People arrived at clustering through trial and error, so HCA is probably the way to go. 

### Long-Term To-Dos:
- Start writing clustering code for small datasets (simulations and ALMA data).
  
- How can we further process simulations ([CASA?](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/Guide_To_Simulating_ALMA_Data) Simple python script for adding image noise?)
