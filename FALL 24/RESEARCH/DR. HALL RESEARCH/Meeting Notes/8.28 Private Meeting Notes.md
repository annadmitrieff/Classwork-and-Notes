## 8/28 Private Meeting Notes
### Work I've Done
#### Toy Model
- Edited toy model somewhat to work with DSHARP dataset.
- Kinda scrappy because the original toy model had me define number of clusters myself, which I didn't change when I tweaked it here, but it's something I am aware of.
- Don't know what specific parameters data was clustered by.
- Used edge detection for centered cropping.
- Used Euclidean Distance, Ward's Linkage, Agglomerative Clustering

#### Goldwater
- I'm applying! Any advice would be appreciated (I have already grilled Lainey).

#### Misc.
- Reached out to Sarah; she gave me the rundown of the 'context,' will be sharing code snippets & Jupyter notebooks within the next few.
- Asked for this so I can see what she tried, what worked, what didn't work, how to optimize stuff, where to go from here without being redundant.

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Consider more refined clustering method:
    - Q: How can I identify what the algorithm is clustering by?
    - Q: Code was only clustering based on image data (HOG)--what other data from .FITS files can I use for more insightful clustering?
    - Rewrite code to eliminate user-defined number of clusters.
    - Clean up code & consider creating a library for this .FITS analysis (I know astropy exists).
    - Consider other clustering/unsupervised methods (k-means alone, hybrid k-means and agglomerative, Constrastive Learning, **suggestions**).
 
- [ ] Produce high-particle disc simulations on Sapelo2 to combine with small DSHARP Dataset; cluster small-but-less-small dataset.
    - Q: How do I simulate ALMA noise? CASA? Simple image editing Python script? 
    - I'm hoping this will serve as a 'base case' for a much larger dataset.
    - Compare with Contrastive Learning results.

- [ ] Work with big dataset and lots of simulations.
    - Compare with contrastive learning results?

#### Sapelo2 Questions
- How to configure setup files using bash script (for job submission scripts)? `sed`?

Here's what I have so far:

- What else should I include in my ~/.bashrc file? More or less copied everything from my local ~/.zshrc.
<img width="580" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-28 at 10 35 50 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65df159d-0561-433f-bc0a-56df1ba6aa1e">

- For example, here are the first 4 lines of a `disc.setup` file:
```
# input file for disc setup routine

# resolution
                  np =     1000000    ! number of gas particles
```

- Would I write the following if I wanted to replace `1000000` with `1E8`?
```
sed '4 s/1000000/1E8 ~/phantom/runs/mydisc/disc.setup
```

Also having some issues installing `giza` (as a part of `Splash`) in my home directory on Sapelo2; I uninstalled it for now with the hope that I can start with a blank slate in today's meeting, but I was getting a few errors that specifically had to do with `giza`--

When I clone `splash` and `giza`, I run into no issues, but I run into the following later on:
```
git clone https://github.com/danieljprice/splash.git          # No issues/errors 
cd splash; git clone https://github.com/danieljprice/giza.git # No issues/errors
make SYSTEM=gfortran withgiza                                 # Produces the error shown below:
```

```

Beyond that, phantom is also being problematic.
I'm following the tutorial for a basic disc simulation to test if things work (using `interactive`).
Compiling phantomsetup gave me the error:

```

```
- Should I add `IMPLICIT NONE` to `findloc` subroutine in `~/phantom/src/setup/set_hierarchical_utils.f90`?
- I do not want to mess around with this stuff without good reason...

===============================

- splash installed as module:
ml SPLASH/3.10.3-foss-2022a

interactive node doesnt always load stuff in bash
specific toolchain for right compiler:
    email jimmy? which foss toolchain he uses
    ask for job submission/bash script too

once up and running:
- couple of test simulations
- what region of parameter space?
- 20-30 simulations of different kinds of discs (more or less planets)

cluster as if you made synthetic image from simulation
run radiative transfer w/ mcfost
see what it would look like at 1.3mm (thermal noise? alma?)
does the orientation of the disc matter?
    - all sims have same orientation to see if thats what matters.
    OR all sims with diff orientation but same parameters.

uniform-izing alma data: only face-on discs, similar resolution discs

full CASA treatment would be better since small dataset

few stages:
1. clustering with no noise

apply to CURO, AAS might not have enough

get things up and running > DO NOT MANUALLY PICK CLUSTERS > define parameter space
