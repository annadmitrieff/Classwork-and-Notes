Although the sample program I've written accepts data in the `.jpeg` file format, astronomical data from Chandra & Webb may offer more detail in alternative formats.

## What Data Does JWST Provide?

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) follows a single science calibration pipeline for processing all observational data. A **science calibration pipeline** is a series of automated data processing steps designed to convert raw observational data from scientific instruments into a form suitable for analysis and scientific interpretation. 

The JWST calibration pipeline has four stages which progressively refine  raw observational data, correcting for instrumental effects, normalizing sensitivities, combining multiple exposures, and preparing the data for detailed scientific analysis:

**1. Detector-Level Calibration**

> This stage corrects for basic instrumental effects and prepares the raw data for higher level calibration. This includes correcting for electronic bias and thermal noise by subtracting bias and dark frames, correcting for non-linear responses of the detector to light, identifying and flagging pixels that have reached or exceeded their saturation limits, converting raw counts to electrons using the detectorâ€™s gain, and detecting and flagging cosmic ray hits that may contaminate the data.

**2. Basic Calibration**

> This stage further refines the data by applying flat field corrections and additional calibrations, transforming the data into a form where flux values are accurate. 
>
> Flat-field correction normalizes pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations using flat field images, which are images acquired by photographing a uniformly-illuminated screen, producing an image of uniform color and brightness across the frame (this can also be done with a clear patch of sky). 
>
> Photometric calibration applies corrections to ensure the flux values are consistent across the field of view, and, for spectroscopic data, wavelength calibration ensures that the wavelength scale is accurately calibrated using known spectral lines.

**3. Data Correction and Combination**

> This stage corrects for geometric distortions, combines multiple exposures, and prepares the data for scientific analysis.


**4. Higher-Level Calibration and Analysis**
